### Technical note

Many technical problems will vanish if you use the latest version of R (3.6.1) and RStudio (1.2). R and RStudio are distinct products and must be installed separately.

### Homework

- Make sure R and R Studio work.
- Use template hw1 to create a new private repository with the name `hw1-<your-github-name>`.
- Clone the newly created repository, using GitHub Desktop (install if you haven't already).
- Open `hw1.Rproj` in your file manager.
- Follow the steps described in `lesson01.R`.
- Make some changes, commit and push.
- Your changes should now be visible in GitHub.

## Knitting into `docs/`

The two files `_site.yml` and `index.Rmd` ensure that the output for all "knit document" tasks is copied to the `docs/` directory, where it is picked up by GitHub Pages.
You can copy these files into your repositories to enable this feature.
